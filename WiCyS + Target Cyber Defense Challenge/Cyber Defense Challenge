CYBER DEFENSE CHALLENGE MADE POSSIBLE BY TARGET
We are back with the 2nd annual Target Cyber Defense Challenge! The challenge will give WiCyS members hands-on experience and a taste of what it’s like to be on a cyber defense team. From tackling intel-driven scenarios to experiencing current threats in the landscape, this challenge will offer many learning opportunities. Join the challenge and learn about the newest threat…Shiny Scorpion.

This engaging program is for WiCyS members to dive in, gain new learning experiences, network with an inclusive cohort of peers, work one-on-one with the Target cybersecurity team, and explore what threat detection and intelligence are all about.

The top 10 participants will also receive a scholarship to attend the 2024 WiCyS Conference.
