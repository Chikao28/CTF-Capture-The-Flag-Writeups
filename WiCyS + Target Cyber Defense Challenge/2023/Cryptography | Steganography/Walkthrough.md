I used CyberChef and used the ROT13 cipher to dedode the string "GUR GNETRG UNF ORRA NPDHVERQ" and received the flag.
FLAG: {THE TARGET HAS BEEN ACQUIRED}

In this particular challenge, a questionable email arrives with an "attachment" containing a scorpion picture. Whenever a PNG file is included in a Capture The Flag (CTF) scenario, I find it beneficial to employ zsteg, a tool designed to reveal concealed information within png images.

I ran zsteg and successfully extracted the Least Significant Bit (LSB) data: KaierljsipvgbediecsvhrrscaEvvqyq=====

Following the clues provided in the challenge description, I applied the Vigen√®re cipher to decrypt the aforementioned string. Knowing that this cipher involves a key, I contemplated the possibility of another element concealing the key. Despite my thorough investigation, I couldn't locate any such component. As a last resort, I decided to try the name of the ransomware gang, "shinyscorpion," and to my delight, it turned out to be the correct key!

FLAG: {Start the ransomware attack on Monday}
