In Tier 2, the top 50 from Tier 1 will learn how to recover from an attack and get a chance to leverage decryption tools. Finally, in Tier 3 the Tier 2 top 10 challengers will summarize and give a presentation to Target & WiCyS on what their biggest takeaways from this Cyber Defense Challenge were!
