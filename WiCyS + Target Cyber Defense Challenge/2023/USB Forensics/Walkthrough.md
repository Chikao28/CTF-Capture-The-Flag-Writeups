In this particular challenge, we are presented with a pcap file. To tackle the task, we meticulously analyzed the file, carefully identifying and categorizing the various devices depicted within. During this process, I successfully identified the Blue Yeti device, which ultimately led me to discover the flag concealed within its data.

FLAG{(B58E)(0005)}

This challenge presented a direct question that required a brief answer. After conducting a quick google search, I promptly discovered the flag

FLAG{USBMS}

To tackle this challenge, I utilized CyberChef and uploaded the pcap file. I used the "extract files" operation, which allowed me to uncover several files within the pcap. While inspecting these files, I came across an image that contained the hidden flag.

To solve this challenge, I began by downloading the pcap file and filtering it based on the condition `usb.data_len == 4` to locate the required packets. I then exported those specific packets for further analysis. To guide me through the remaining steps, I referred to a helpful resource, specifically https://disconnect3d.pl/2016/05/02/Google-CTF-2016-For2-writeup/.

As part of the solution, I had to create a separate script to ensure that colons were added after every two characters. This step was crucial to follow the required formatting. By combining these techniques and resources, I successfully completed the challenge.

In a similar scenario as before, we were provided with a pcap file and tasked with plotting the data. However, this time our objective was to convert keystroke data into their corresponding characters.

To initiate the process, I created a filter using 'usb.src == '1.11.4'' and focused on identifying the HID (Human Interface Device) data within the file. To navigate through the subsequent steps, I sought guidance from a useful resource, specifically https://github.com/bolisettynihith/USB-Keyboard-Parser.

I successfully implemented a Python script I found online which that played a crucial role in solving the challenge. This script was designed to leverage a set of predetermined USB hex codes and perform an iterative process through the data stored in the keypress_data.txt file. As a result of this execution, I achieved the desired outcome, obtaining the flag.
