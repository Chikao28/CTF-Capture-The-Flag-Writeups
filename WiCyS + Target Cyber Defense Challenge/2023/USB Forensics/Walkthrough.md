In this particular challenge, we are presented with a pcap file. To tackle the task, we meticulously analyzed the file, carefully identifying and categorizing the various devices depicted within. During this process, I successfully identified the Blue Yeti device, which ultimately led me to discover the flag concealed within its data.
